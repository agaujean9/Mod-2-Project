# Summary

Using a dataset that contained NBA combine attributes for prospective NBA basketball players from the years 2007-2019, we trained a model that would predict an NBA prospects draft stock. In addition, we incorporated secondary data on the players that we thought could be significant predictors, but were not available in our primary dataset. The objective was to create a linear regression model that would rank a player from 1-60, or the highest draft stock to the lowest draft stock. We understand that a linear regression model is not the ideal model choice to predict a target data that does not display a normal distribution. However, considering our deep understanding of the NBA and NBA Draft and the nuances of our dataset, which I will explain further we believe that we can construct a model with enough predictive power to be a success.
